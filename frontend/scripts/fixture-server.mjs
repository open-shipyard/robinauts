/**
 * A built `dist/` served with fixture answers, for looking at the shell.
 *
 * A development tool. It is not in the bundle, not in the wheel and not part
 * of any check: it exists so that a person -- or a browser driven by one --
 * can see the interface in a state the backend would take a database and a
 * sign-in to produce. It answers exactly the routes the code here calls, and
 * refuses everything else.
 *
 *     npm run build
 *     node scripts/fixture-server.mjs signed-in 5173
 *
 * The scene is the first argument: `signed-in`, `one-agent`, `no-agents`,
 * `local`, `signed-out`, `history`, `conversation`, `streaming`, `reattach`
 * or `error`. It binds loopback only.
 *
 * A failed sign-in is the `signed-out` scene at the hash the backend
 * redirects to: `http://127.0.0.1:5173/#/sign-in?error=not_allowed`.
 *
 * **Which conversation is open is the hash**, so `history` and `conversation`
 * differ in what they list rather than in what they serve: `history` has
 * enough conversations to page through, `conversation` the three a
 * conversation can be in --
 * `#/c/c0000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000001` (a branch),
 * `…002` (a run in flight) and `…003` (a run that ended badly).
 *
 * Renaming, deleting and cancelling really change what this serves, so the
 * states after them can be looked at too. Nothing is written to disk: a
 * restart is a fresh set of fixtures.
 *
 * **The three scenes with a stream in them** answer the streaming routes of
 * `docs/specs/wire.md` for real -- server-sent events, a position on the last
 * wire event derived from each of the run's own, and the two headers -- so
 * that the chat can be looked at doing what it is for:
 *
 * - `streaming`: sending a message streams a stretch of thinking and then an
 *   answer, a few words at a time;
 * - `reattach`: conversation `…002` has a run going, so opening it attaches
 *   to that run at the `resume.after` the conversation answered with, and the
 *   rest of the answer arrives;
 * - `error`: the same turn, ending in `RUN_ERROR`.
 *
 * A turn really writes its messages into the conversation, so the reread that
 * follows one shows what the store would.
