/**
 * The npm licence gate: the policy of DEPENDENCIES.md over everything the
 * lockfile pins and npm installed.
 *
 * `vite.config.ts` gates the **bundle** -- the code that ships, whether it
 * arrived through rollup's module graph or through a CSS `@import` -- and
 * records it in `bundled-packages.txt`; it reads the allowed list from here,
 * so there is one copy of it. This gate judges the whole installed tree,
 * because DEPENDENCIES.md asks the same questions of a development dependency
 * as of any other. Neither one stands in for the other: a row's `scope` is
 * about dependency edges, and says nothing about what reached the bundle.
 *
 * What is not plainly on the allowed list needs a row in the "JavaScript
 * build tooling" table of DEPENDENCIES.md naming the same version, the same
 * licence and the right scope. A forbidden licence fails whatever a row says,
 * and so does a claim nobody can read. A row for an installed package that no
 * longer needs one, or for a package the lockfile no longer pins at all,
 * fails too, so the table cannot go stale across a bump.
 *
 * The node standard library and nothing else: a gate that needed vetting
 * would be one more thing to vet.
 *
 *     node scripts/check-licences.mjs
 *
 * Exit 1 is "a dependency fails the policy"; exit 2 is "the gate could not do
 * its work", as in scripts/licence_gate.py.
