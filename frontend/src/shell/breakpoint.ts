 * Which of the two layouts is on, as a value React can read.
 *
 * The panel is a rail beside the page on a wide screen and an overlay drawer
 * on a narrow one, and CSS decides which by a breakpoint. Most of that needs
 * no JavaScript -- the classes do it -- but three things cannot be said in
 * CSS at all: `inert`, `role="dialog"` and a focus trap. A closed drawer is
 * translated off the screen, not removed, so without `inert` it is six
 * invisible tab stops, sign-out among them.
 *
 * So the same breakpoint is read once more, here, through `matchMedia`: one
 * number in two places, and the comment below is the reason it is allowed to
 * be.

 * `rem`, not the 768px it usually comes to: a `rem` in a media query is the
 * browser's *default* font size, which a reader may have set to anything,
 * and at 24px Tailwind's `48rem` is 1152px while a hard-coded 768px is not.
 * The two would then disagree about which layout is on -- CSS drawing the
 * drawer while this said "wide", so the off-screen panel would keep every
 * tab stop and the open drawer would be no dialog at all. A browser
 * resolves `48rem` here exactly as it does in the stylesheet, so there is
 * one answer rather than two. If the breakpoint moves, both move.
