 *
 * No router library. Two routes, one event, and a store the size of this

 * in the bundle for something React already provides through
 * `useSyncExternalStore` (`docs/contributing/js-dependencies.md`).

 * **Anything else is the empty chat**, `#/sign-in?error=…` included -- the
 * hash the backend sends a failed sign-in back to, which
 * `src/session/SignInPage.tsx` reads for itself. Reading a hash never writes
 * one: an unknown hash is answered with the empty chat, and the address bar
 * is left saying whatever it said, so nothing here can destroy a hash
 * another part of the interface is still reading.
