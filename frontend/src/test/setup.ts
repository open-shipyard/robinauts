/**
 * What jsdom does not have and the chat window asks a browser for.
 *
 * jsdom implements no layout, so the three below are simply absent rather
 * than wrong: the chat's message viewport observes its own size and the size
 * of the message it is anchored to, and scrolls itself to the bottom. None
 * of them is a thing a test here asserts about -- what is tested is what is
 * on the screen and what was sent -- and without them a render throws and
 * every test of a page holding the chat fails for a reason that is not about
 * the page.
 *
 * Written out rather than taken from a package: three empty methods, and a
 * dependency would be a dependency.
