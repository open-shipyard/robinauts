 * state library: one list, asked for once and again after anything changes
 * it, which is what `src/session/session.ts` already does for the session.
 *
 * A hook rather than a module store, because there is one of these on the
 * page -- the shell owns it, passes it to the panel, and reads the open
 * conversation's title out of it -- and a module store would be state to
 * reset between two tests for no gain.
 *
 * **Paging walks a list that is changing**, not a transaction over a frozen
 * one: a conversation written to while somebody is paging moves in the order
 * and may be seen twice. The spec says an interface that cares folds by id,
 * and this one does.
