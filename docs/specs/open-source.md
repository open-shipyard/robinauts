# Open source

Goal 1: Apache-2.0, safe inside a company and safe to embed in a
commercial product. The project follows the "foundation-ready" policy,
whose premise is that foundations and corporate legal teams accept
provenance, not code: for any line in the tree, one can show who wrote it,
when, under what licence, and that they had the right to.

The list of things to do is [oss-checklist.md](../oss-checklist.md).

## Identity

- The name is Robinauts. The repository is `open-shipyard/robinauts`, in an
  organisation, not a personal account.

## Licence

- Apache-2.0, unmodified, for everything in the repository, documentation
  included. No dual licence, no added restriction.
- Every source file carries `SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0` and
  `Copyright The Robinauts Authors`. `REUSE.toml` covers files that cannot
  carry a header. Every byte in the tree has a stated licence.
- `NOTICE` holds required attributions only.

## Contributions

- DCO sign-off on every commit, from the first. No CLA.
- AI coding assistants are allowed. By signing off, a contributor states
  that they reviewed every line, that it reproduces no incompatibly
  licensed code, and that substantially machine-generated files or blocks
  are disclosed in the pull request.
- No code from Stack Overflow or blogs. Nothing copied or ported from a
  forbidden or unlicensed source.
- Code that enters the tree other than through an ordinary signed-off pull
  request is recorded in `docs/legal/ip-clearance.md`: where it came from,
  at which commit, under what licence, where it landed, what was changed.
  Known cases: the layout convention from fetchy, the sign-in design from
  neorc, the vendored assistant-ui components.
- Third-party assets and vendored code are listed in
  `docs/legal/third-party.md`. An upstream header is never stripped.
- No squash-imports; `main` is never force-pushed.

## Dependency licences

The ASF category model — the strictest in use. Written for contributors
in `DEPENDENCIES.md`.

- **Allowed:** Apache-2.0, MIT, BSD-2-Clause, BSD-3-Clause, 0BSD, ISC,
  Zlib, PostgreSQL, PSF-2.0, CC0-1.0, Unlicense.
- **Restricted:** MPL-2.0 (also EPL-2.0, CDDL), only as an unmodified,
  unbundled dependency, each one listed by name with its reason.
- **Forbidden, including transitively:** GPL, AGPL, LGPL (every version,
  dynamic linking included), SSPL, BSL, Elastic, Commons Clause,
  CC-BY-NC/ND, any "no commercial use" or "do no evil" term, proprietary,
  and **no licence at all**.
- Development-only and test-only dependencies follow the same lists. One
  may be excepted only by name, with a reason.
- The JavaScript bundle is bundled code: the allowed list only.
- Assets — fonts, icons, images, fixtures, sample data, model files,
  tokenizers — need a stated licence on the allowed list. No model weights
  or datasets are shipped. No third-party logos are shipped.
- Adopting a dependency means: the gates pass at the pinned version; the
  package is what it claims to be; the reason for it is in the pull
  request. A licence is re-checked on every bump.

## Checks

On GitHub Actions, all blocking, all present from day zero:

- Python: a licence gate over the full locked set, failing on unknown
  licences too; a vulnerability audit.
- JavaScript: the build-time licence allowlist; the committed list of
  bundled packages compared with the build; `npm audit`;
  `npm audit signatures`.
- `reuse lint`; a DCO check; secret scanning; the architecture contracts
  ([layout.md](../layout.md)); the lint rule that confines assistant-ui.
- Dependabot for pip, npm and GitHub Actions, with a 10-day cooldown.
  Actions are pinned to commit SHAs.

## Releases

- Built in CI from a signed tag; published by trusted publishing, with no
  long-lived token.
- `LICENSE`, `NOTICE` and the third-party licence texts are inside the
  wheel.
- Each release carries an SBOM.

## Details likely to change

- Tools: `pip-audit`; `pip-licenses` or an equivalent for the Python gate;
  `rollup-plugin-license` for the bundle; `gitleaks`; `syft` for the SBOM.
- Known findings:
  - `psycopg` and `psycopg-pool` are LGPL-3.0-only: excluded; `asyncpg` is
    used. Consequently `langgraph-checkpoint-postgres` cannot be adopted
    as it is
    ([ADR 0002](../adr/0002-conversation-persistence.md)).
  - `certifi` is MPL-2.0 and arrives with the HTTP client: the known
    restricted case, unmodified and unbundled.
  - `assistant-cloud` arrives with `@assistant-ui/react`: its licence
    passes, and it is never configured.
- The two agent frameworks and their provider clients are the largest
  dependency surface, and the likeliest source of a future conflict.
