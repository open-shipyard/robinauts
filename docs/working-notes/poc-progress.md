# POC progress

The plan is [poc-scope.md](poc-scope.md). The process is the three-agent
recipe (`recipes/three-agent-steps.md`, beside this repository).

## What exists

For a reader with no memory of it. Kept short; rewritten as the steps land.

- `docs/specs/` — the specs; start at `core.md`. `docs/adr/` — two
  decisions that needed a discussion. `docs/layout.md` — the backend layers
  and their enforced dependency rules.
- `backend/` — an empty skeleton of the `robinauts` package with every
  layer as an empty sub-package, `pyproject.toml` with the import-linter
  contracts, and `tests/unit/test_architecture.py` which runs them.
  Checks: `uv run pytest`, `uv run ruff check .`, `uv run black --check .`
  from `backend/`.
- Open source groundwork at the root: `NOTICE`, `AUTHORS`,
  `CONTRIBUTING.md` (DCO, AI-assisted contributions, where code may come
  from), `DEPENDENCIES.md` (licence categories, the named restricted and
  excluded packages), `REUSE.toml` and `LICENSES/`; `docs/legal/` with the
  IP clearance log, the third-party list, the name-search and assets
  records. `uvx reuse lint` passes from the root: a new root-level file
  must be added to `REUSE.toml`, and prose that quotes a licence tag or
  someone else's copyright line goes between `REUSE-IgnoreStart` /
  `REUSE-IgnoreEnd` comments.
- No CI yet. No frontend yet.

## Steps

### Step 0 — documents   (feature/poc-0-documents)

Summary: the open source groundwork — `NOTICE`, `AUTHORS`,
`CONTRIBUTING.md`, `DEPENDENCIES.md`, `REUSE.toml`, `LICENSES/`, and
`docs/legal/` (IP clearance log with the neorc sign-in design as first
entry, third-party list, name-search and assets records). `reuse lint`
passes over the whole tree. Implemented by the driver. CI, `SECURITY.md`,
the code of conduct and governance files are not in this step.

Review: 1 round.
- High: 2
  - No provenance record for the backend layout convention — left as is, by
    the project owner's decision: it is his own earlier work, contributed
    under the DCO. `CONTRIBUTING.md` now states the rule that covers it
    (one's own earlier work, sole rights).
  - `DEPENDENCIES.md` claimed the build enforces the licence rules while no
    CI exists — fixed: reviewers check by hand until the gate lands
    (step 1).
- Medium: 5 (5/0)
- Low: 4 (4/0)

Checks: `uvx reuse lint` (compliant, 46 files), `uv run pytest` in
`backend/` (1 passed).
Not done / to watch: step 1 must remove the "until that gate is in place"
sentence from `DEPENDENCIES.md` once the gate exists. Branch protection and
the DCO check are GitHub settings for the project owner.
Important design decisions made / open questions: `pgserver` is not to be a
dependency (no licence metadata) — tests take the URL of a PostgreSQL they
are given. The name-search record is still to be added by the owner.
