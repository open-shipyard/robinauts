"""An engine that calls its one tool on every turn and answers a fixed string plus the result.

A prompt that starts with ``poison`` ends its turn badly instead: the tool returns an error and
the engine raises, as a real engine does when a tool keeps failing.

It keeps nothing: every session exists, every checkpoint is accepted, each turn hands out a new
one, and no turn reads an earlier one. So it does not keep the memory half of the contract, and
is for quick smoke tests of the interface and for tests that need a turn and nothing more.
