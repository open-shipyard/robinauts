"""The security headers every HTTP answer carries, refusals included.

The policy is the interface's (``docs/specs/frontend.md``). An API answer carries it too: it
has no document to govern, so there it does nothing, and one list is simpler than two.
``nosniff`` keeps a browser from reading a JSON body as a script, and ``same-origin`` keeps a
path, which can name a conversation, from going to a site a person clicks through to.
