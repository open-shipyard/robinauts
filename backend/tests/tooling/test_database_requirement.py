"""When a missing database is a skipped test, and when it is a failed run.

A skip is the right answer on a laptop with no PostgreSQL and the wrong one
in CI: a typo in the URL, a service container that never started, a variable
dropped from the workflow -- and the tests that prove the store works stop
running while the build stays green. ``ROBINAUTS_REQUIRE_POSTGRES`` is how a
build says it will not accept that.

The guard lives here rather than beside the database tests because those
modules skip themselves, and a skipped module cannot fail a run. This one
never skips.
