# The release artifact: one wheel holding the backend, the schema and the built
# interface (docs/specs/frontend.md). The frontend is built first, because the
# wheel cannot be built without it -- backend/hatch_build.py refuses -- and
# because built files are never committed, so there is nothing to be stale.
#
# One argument: the directory to write the wheel into. It prints the path of
# the wheel it built and nothing else on stdout, so that a caller can read it;
# beside the wheel it also writes `requirements.txt`, the locked runtime set
# with its hashes, which is how a deployment installs the versions the gates
# judged rather than whatever pip resolves on the day (docs/deployment.md).

# installs this first and then the wheel with --no-deps

# which is what makes `pip install --require-hashes` possible.

# Its own command and not the left-hand side of a pipeline, and into the
