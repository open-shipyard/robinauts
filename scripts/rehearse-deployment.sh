# Walk docs/deployment.md on this machine, as far as a machine with no domain
# name, no identity provider and no model key can be walked. A development
# tool. No check runs it, and no check lints it either: there is no
# shellcheck in this repository, for any script. Its Python half is judged by
# ruff and black through scripts/check-lint.sh, which reads scripts/ as well
# as the backend.
#
# What it does, in the order the guide does it: build the wheel, make a virtual
# environment and install it, create a throwaway role and database, create the
# schema with `robinauts db init`, make a self-signed certificate, and hand
# over to scripts/rehearse_deployment.py for everything that needs a browser
# (the stand-in identity providers, the TLS terminator, the sign-ins, the
# conversations, the stream). Then it puts the database back.
#
# Usage: scripts/rehearse-deployment.sh [work-directory] [admin-database-url]
#
# The admin url is a PostgreSQL this may create and drop a database on. The
# default is the throwaway cluster these notes are written against.
# ROBINAUTS_REHEARSAL_PORTS is "<backend> <proxy>" when a development machine
# already has something on 8000 or 8443; the rehearsal refuses to proxy to
# whatever else is listening rather than reporting on somebody else's server.
